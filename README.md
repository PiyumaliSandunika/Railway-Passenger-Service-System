# Railway-Passenger-Service-System
This project is to design online platform for railway passengers. It allows the user to inquire about trains depending on the route and date, get the details, and book seats conveniently. Inquiries can also be made about the status of the booked tickets, and ticket cancellations are also facilitated.
